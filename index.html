Not every keyboard have to be fancy, bespoke or custom. This is a very simple traymount Tofu build with aluminium plate.
But the color combinations really does it for me. The black case, the dark modifiers with their colorful legends and the bright alphas make it subtle yet striking.
The lubed Revo Clear switches combined with a dampening mat in the case make it sound thoccy and good.

The Gateron Silent Inks make this keyboard very silent and office friendly. The layout is 65% but with two extra columns to the left for either macros or as in my case; F-keys.
The case has superior finish and the weight and the logo on it is superb. Simple a grade A keyboard.

This is the third idb designed keyboard I had the opportunity to get my hands on. The idb Ergo is a different kind of typing experience with the 18 degree angled layout and still being a single unit.
In true current idb spirit the idb Ergo is plateless making it flexible, without being spongy, and reducing vibrations. Case is milled out of solid aluminum.
The layout is 60% WKL with three additional switches top left.

The Borsdorf keyboard was a small discord groupbuy by DarthWTF. Approximately 10 units were made. 
It has a carbon fiber plate and original keycaps, switches and stabilizers from an old Apple AEK II keyboard. It has the signature thinner ISO enter.
The layout is between 60% and 65% with dedicated arrow cluster and a couple of nav keys. The size is still compact and the extra keys makes it more useable for me over a standard 60% keyboard since I like my arrows.

The idb60 prototype was a small discord groupbuy by idb keyboards. Approximately 10 units were made, some anodized and some in raw aluminium. I chosed raw aluminum to be able to either paint it or polish it. 
It features plateless design where the PCB is suspended on o-ring-dampened tabs that are sandwiched between the top and bottom.
Layout is 60% WKL with stepped CapsLock and split right shift. It is built with C3 Tangerine switches with a Hirose spacebar switch and GMK screw-in stabs

This is a keyboard called Bok.cp from TX keyboards but without the TX “lip” and designed by Bok instead of LZ (Don’t quote me on this though).
The layout is a compact 1800, hence the cp in the name. The finish is called antique copper and is exquisite. No marks, flaws or inconsistensies.
Both plate and weight are brass and there’s an acrylic diffuser layer between the aluminium top and bottom part. 
The stabilizers are GMK screw-ins.

The Cypher is a compact f-rowless 1800 layout keyboard, which means it is somewhat close to fullsize in regard that it has a numpad and arrow cluster, but is lacking the f-row (f1-f12) and one or two rows (depending on size) above the numpad.
What they lack in number of keys they make in nimble size and portability. The f-row is reached using Fn-key and numrow.
Furthermore do they have three leds between numlock and backspace for caps lock, num lock and scroll lock.

The keyboard sounds and feels very nice and althought I am not a super fan of the 60% layout it’s a very nice typing experience, and it looks stunning.
The sound is deep, muted and has a nice thocc to it, but since it’s a tray-mounted PCB it’s a bit inconsistent due to the unevenly spread mounting points.
There’s some very small o-rings between the stand-offs and PCB to further reduce the vibrations. Paired with the purple deskmat it is really a purple overdose.

This is quite a good everyday carry keyboard since its small and not that heavy. Also ordered a pouch for it and thats padded making it quite protective.
The mounting method has been improved vastly since previous version, but it's still not the best.
Now there's an option to either mount the PCB to the case and have the switches securing the plate, or screwing both plate and PCB to the case.
I went for the first option to minimize that the plate vibrations gets transported to the case.

It is wired using single core wiring and a Teensy 2.0 as MCU. It turned out great, but it's quite difficult to master.

The keyboard is top mounted, meaning the plate screws into the top of the case and lastly the bottom is screwed in place.

This is a custom build using a Mexican ebony case by a Redditor from the US, carbon fiber plate from a guy in Netherlands and a PCB from yet another guy in Germany.
This makes it close to the Tada68, but with better bottom row with 1.5-1.5-1-1-1 instead of six 1u caps to the rights of the spacebar. The T1 night switches are tactile and loud, but in a quite good way.
The case is of course very heavy due to the high density of the Mexican ebony. It also very scratch and dent-resistant.

Bought this from AliExpress mostly because it was very cheap and I wanted to test split again. It is quite a large keyboard with the 75% layout and the extra two columns to the left.
The keyboard case is built using six layers of acrylic, either black or transparent, where the plate is one and held together with screw. The two halves are connected using a Mini-USB cable.
There are three indicator LEDs in the upper left corner. I decided on unlubed normal Gateron black switches due to them also being cheap. So it sounds quite bad but on the other hand is this not really a everyday keyboard either.

This is just to try larger ortho keyboards. It's a Boardwalk PCB with stainless steel plate in a acrylic Tofu case with green Fei switches and GMK Carbon keycaps.
The switches are not lubed so there's some ping from the springs. It's not bad, but could definitly be better. When I have the time I will fix that.
Didn't bother with pictures of the PCB or a build log, so there's no additional information on the build itself.

One should always have a stand-alone numpad because reasons. Since many of my keyboards don't have a numpad I though a separate one would be needed. But no, I never use the numpad.
