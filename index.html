The idb60 prototype was a small discord groupbuy by idb keyboards. Approximately 10 units were made, some anodized and some in raw aluminium. I chosed raw aluminum to be able to either paint it or polish it. 
It features plateless design where the PCB is suspended on o-ring-dampened tabs that are sandwiched between the top and bottom.
Layout is 60% WKL with stepped CapsLock and split right shift. It is built with C3 Tangerine switches with a Hirose spacebar switch and GMK screw-in stabs

This is a keyboard called Bok.cp from TX keyboards but without the TX “lip” and designed by Bok instead of LZ (Don’t quote me on this though).
The layout is a compact 1800, hence the cp in the name. The finish is called antique copper and is exquisite. No marks, flaws or inconsistensies.
Both plate and weight are brass and there’s an acrylic diffuser layer between the aluminium top and bottom part. 
The stabilizers are GMK screw-ins.

The Cypher is a compact f-rowless 1800 layout keyboard, which means it is somewhat close to fullsize in regard that it has a numpad and arrow cluster, but is lacking the f-row (f1-f12) and one or two rows (depending on size) above the numpad.
What they lack in number of keys they make in nimble size and portability. The f-row is reached using Fn-key and numrow.
Furthermore do they have three leds between numlock and backspace for caps lock, num lock and scroll lock.

The keyboard sounds and feels very nice and althought I am not a super fan of the 60% layout it’s a very nice typing experience, and it looks stunning.
The sound is deep, muted and has a nice thocc to it, but since it’s a tray-mounted PCB it’s a bit inconsistent due to the unevenly spread mounting points.
There’s some very small o-rings between the stand-offs and PCB to further reduce the vibrations. Paired with the purple deskmat it is really a purple overdose.

This is quite a good everyday carry keyboard since its small and not that heavy. Also ordered a pouch for it and thats padded making it quite protective.
The mounting method has been improved vastly since previous version, but it's still not the best.
Now there's an option to either mount the PCB to the case and have the switches securing the plate, or screwing both plate and PCB to the case.
I went for the first option to minimize that the plate vibrations gets transported to the case. If it really was an improvement over the plate+pcb mounting option I couldn't really tell actually since the sound from the undampened case was so nasty

This keyboard was designed and engineered by idb and has a case in aluminium that has been beadblasted and anodized in silver. Only three has been made by idb as a testrun so far. Custom brushed steel ISO plate without slots for winkey from Laserboost.
QMK-programmable 60xt PCB supporting both ANSI and ISO. This keyboard has a distinct nod to the IBM XT keyboard, but back in the days the section on the left was used for F1-F10.

Designed the layout in KLE and sent to Lasergist using swillkb.
I Think I got the cable management as good as it was possible and theTeensy is fastened with hotglue.
The case was a collaboration together with fellow Redditor u/johananasen who also modelled the case in Fusion 360 and then CNC routered the case from oak.
The name Gregg came from when posting the keyboard on Reddit and asking for ideas regarding names.

Got in on a group buy by Ymdk for a case and plate setup. Chose blue upper part of case and gold lower part and plate.
Took a few month but it finally arrived. The case is called Melody96 and was sold with a PCB as well, but that PCB was fitted with USB-C and I want Mini-USB.
Got them to remove the PCB from the order. I still had a Ymd96 PCB since before when I ordered two of them. The keyboard is topmounted, meaning the plate screws into the top of the case and lastly the bottom is screwed in place.

This is a custom build using a Mexican ebony case by a Redditor from the US, carbon fiber plate from a guy in Netherlands and a PCB from yet another guy in Germany.
This makes it close to the Tada68, but with better bottom row with 1.5-1.5-1-1-1 instead of six 1u caps to the rights of the spacebar. The T1 night switches are tactile and loud, but in a quite good way.
The case is of course very heavy due to the high density of the Mexican ebony. It also very scratch and dent-resistant.

Need to have a keyboard with plastic case to be able to compare against the more high-end aluminum ones.
It is quite nice though and the sound is muted and free from any metallic noises.
Tried split backspace/del layout but that is actually quite horrible. It is not easy to hit backspace that small when used to one twice as big.
There's no additional information page on this since there really isn't much more to say about it.

I thought i needed a macropad for...macros. And well, I sorta did since I use it as Ctrl+F5 when building websites to reload the pages.
Also Installed holtites for the switches (making them hotswapable) in the PCB to be able to use it as a switchtester as well.
Not really anything else to say about it, and no gallery link :)

One should always have a stand-alone numpad because reasons. Since many of my keyboards don't have a numpad I though a separate one would be needed. But no, I never use the numpad.

This has been an ongoing project since June 2018. Most of the things has been replaced over the time.
Changed from Rev4 to Rev6 PCB, replaced the stainless steel plate with a carbon fiber one and had a grey hipro case for a while too.
Incoming right now are a purple hipro case, purple plate and an extension kit including a rotary encoder with a knob. Will update post along the way.

This is really the only prebuilt keyboard in my collection, and I could not leave that one alone either.
The Cherry brown switches was replaced with milky Gateron clears, the case dampened with sound dampening mat and the plate sealed with electrical tape to reduce vibrations.
Now it very silent and feels nice, but the Gateron clears are way to light for my taste making a lot of accidental keypresses.
